If you have any trouble getting the lab started, you may have to install pynput on your machine.
First, make sure you have Python downloaded on your machine, if not, you can type Python in PowerShell and the Microsoft Store will open, allowing you to download Pyhton there.
Once completed, open PowerShell and type " python -m pip install pynput"; you don't need the quotation marks.
After that is done, you should be able to run the script.
